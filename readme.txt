This is a demo of how to download files from a flask server using a RESTful
API call from a React app. For fun, the images are generated using the
half-precision version of the stable-diffusion-2 model.

After pip installing the requirements, navigate into /sd2-front and run
`npm install --save react react-dom reactstrap bootstrap`

Then using the Windows CMD it is easiest to use the start.bat file to run
both the flask server and react app.
